# **Movie Finder App**
### A ***simple***, ***unrefined*** and ***possibly*** outdated app that shows you on which streaming platform you can find a movie.

### I used the the *"Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+"* dataset from [Kaggle]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney") for this project.

### Due to my lack of Front-End skill, I prefered to use [Streamlit]("https://docs.streamlit.io/") to make the App.

#### TO-DO
- [ ] Clean up code
- [ ] Find *up-to-date* information
- [ ] Automate the process
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit
